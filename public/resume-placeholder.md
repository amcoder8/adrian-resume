# Resume PDF Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the resume PDF. In a real application, you would replace this with an actual PDF file.

To add your resume:
1. Create your resume in PDF format
2. Name it `resume.pdf`
3. Place it in the `public` folder
4. The download functionality in the Hero component will automatically work

The current implementation provides a download link that will attempt to download `/resume.pdf` from the public folder.
