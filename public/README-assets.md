# Adrian Resume

This is a placeholder for the actual resume PDF file. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:

- **resume.pdf** - The actual PDF version of Adrian's resume
- **og-image.jpg** - A 1200x630px social media preview image

To add these files:
1. Export your resume as a PDF and name it `resume.pdf`
2. Create a professional social media preview image (1200x630px) and name it `og-image.jpg`
3. Place both files in the `/public` directory

These files will be automatically served at the root URL:
- Resume: `/resume.pdf`
- Social Image: `/og-image.jpg`
